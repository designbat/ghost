I work with clients to deliver meaningful learning experiences grounded in adult learning theory. I also help Senior Leaders to articulate what their teams really need, and manage training programs that enable those goals. 

- As an instructional systems designer, I help teams determine the "why" behind a skillset and design courses that deliver enhanced critical thinking and workplace performance.
- As a program manager, I help entire teams rethink how training can support their strategic goals.

Specialties: Instructional design, graphic design, project management, program management, analysis, psychology.

Technologies: Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, Adobe Connect, MS Teams, Lectora Inspire, PowerApps, Excel.

This site allows me to share information about current, past and future projects.
