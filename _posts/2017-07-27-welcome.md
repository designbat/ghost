I work with clients to deliver meaningful learning experiences. I help Senior Leaders articulate what their teams really need, and use instructional design and procurement to help them meet those goals. 

- As an instructional systems designer, I help teams determine the "why" behind a skillset and designing courses that help learners build their critical thinking skills and enhance their workplace efficiency.
- As a program manager, I help entire teams rethink their training goals in the larger context of what they hope to achieve, and what skills they still need to get there.

Specialties: Instructional design, graphic design, project management, program management, analysis.

Technologies: Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, Adobe Connect, MS Teams, Lectora Inspire.
