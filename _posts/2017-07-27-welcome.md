I work with clients to deliver meaningful learning experiences grounded in adult learning theory. I also help Senior Leaders to articulate what their teams need, and design training programs that enable those goals. 

- As an instructional systems designer, I help teams determine the "why" behind a skillset and design and develop courses that deliver enhanced critical thinking and workplace performance.
- As a program manager, I help entire teams rethink how training can support their strategic goals.

Specialties: Instructional design, graphic design, project management, program management, analysis, psychology.

Technologies: Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, Adobe Connect, MS Teams, Lectora Inspire, PowerApps, Excel.

This site hosts information about my current, past and future projects. 

## Other Projects

I also have two side projects: 
- Random Tea Party - A performance art project bringing a love of afternoon tea to unexpected spaces
- Ghosts of Falls Church - An online history project exploring history in the 'Little City" of Falls Church, Virginia and its surrounding communities

Outside of work, I spend lots of time with my two kiddos, read about emerging technology, and enjoy drinking coffee and sketching alongside my adorable orange kitty, Schrodinger.
